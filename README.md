# ChatGPT Clone Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my ChatGPT Clone Project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of a chatbot powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology.

- **Real-time Responses**: Instantaneous responses from the chatbot, simulating a natural conversation.
- **Customization Options**: Options for customizing the chatbot's behavior and appearance.

- **API Integration**: Integrates with the GPT API to generate responses based on user input.
